:::info Note

Mind that Detox works, at least officially, with the following React Native versions:

| iOS             | Android                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0.68.x - 0.70.7 | 0.68.x - 0.70.7 -<br/>Visibility edge-case: see this [RN issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23870) |

Newer versions, as well as React Native's ["New Architecture"](https://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/landing-page), are most likely supported, but have not been tested out yet.
Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/new/choose) if you find specific problems with more recent React Native versions.

For support for React Native 0.71.x, please track [this issue](https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/3884).
