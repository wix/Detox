# Investigating Failures

There are a few tricks and tools that can help you to understand the reason for test failures, even before you resort to debugging.

## Using Detox test artifacts

Artifacts are very powerful tool to understand your test failure, you can easily make a screenshot, video or even hierarchy of your app under test,
e.g.:

```sh
detox test -c <configuration> --take-screenshots failing --record-videos failing
```

Learn more about [configuration](../config/artifacts.mdx) of Detox test artifacts and available [CLI options](../cli/test.md).

## Switch to verbose log levels

You can get detailed information about the test execution if you use `debug` or `trace` log level:

```sh
detox test -c <configuration> -l trace
```

:::tip

In most cases we recommend using `debug` log level to understand the failed test better.

## Missing elements

If your tests are failing due to non-existent or invisible elements, you can [inspect the native view hierarchy](test-id.mdx#find-your-testid) to understand better the failure reason.

## More recipes

See [Dealing With Problems With Running Tests](../troubleshooting/running-tests.md) guide for more recipes.

## Debugging

If debugging still seems a viable option, please follow our [debugging guide](../introduction/debugging.mdx).
