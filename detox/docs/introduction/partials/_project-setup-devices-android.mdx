To check if a specific Android virtual device (e.g. `Pixel_3a_API_30_x86`) is installed locally, run:

```bash
emulator -list-avds
```

You should see an output like:

```plain text
// highlight-next-line
Pixel_3a_API_30_x86
Pixel_API_30
```

:::tip

If you see `zsh: command not found` (or a similar message), please go back to
[Setting up the environment](../getting-started.mdx#setting-up-the-environment) section
where we were redirecting you to the official **React Native CLI Quickstart**, and make sure you
have completed it.

Provided you have `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` (or `ANDROID_HOME`) environment variables
defined, using an explicit path to `emulator` should help:

<Tabs groupId="desktopOS">
    <TabItem value="darwin" label="MacOS">
        <CodeBlock language="bash">
            $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator/emulator -list-avds
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        <CodeBlock language="bash">
            $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator/emulator -list-avds
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="win32" label="Windows">
        <CodeBlock language="plain text">
            %ANDROID_HOME%\emulator\emulator -list-avds
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you don't see that AVD name, you might use another one from the list â€“ just replace it in Detox config, e.g.:

```diff
   emulator: {
     type: 'android.emulator',
     device: {
-      avdName: 'Pixel_3a_API_30_x86',
+      avdName: 'Pixel_API_30',
     },
   },
```

If the output is completely blank, then you need to open Android Studio and [create a new virtual device (AVD)](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd)
first. Experienced users might do that via [`avdmanager`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/avdmanager), if Android Studio is not installed (e.g. on CI).

:::info

If you wish to use an attached Android device (via USB or wireless network), make sure it is available:

```bash
adb devices
```

If the device is properly connected, you should get an output like this:

```plain text
List of devices attached
2F6315NVPH      device
```

Assuming the device is available (troubleshooting _adb_ issues is out of scope of this tutorial), you just
need to use `android.att.*` Detox configurations instead of `android.emu.*` where required.

:warning: If you have multiple devices connected, replace that loose regular expression (`adbName: '.*'`)
in your Detox config with a specific device name.
