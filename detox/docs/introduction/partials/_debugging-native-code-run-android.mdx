18:26:07.024 detox[45214] i Waiting for you to manually launch your app in Android Studio.

Instrumentation class: com.wix.detox.test.test/com.example.DetoxTestAppJUnitRunner
Instrumentation arguments:
------------------------------------
Key            | Value
------------------------------------
detoxServer    | ws://localhost:8099
detoxSessionId | test
------------------------------------

Press any key to continue...
```

Now it is time to switch back to Android Studio. Youâ€™ll need to run your instrumentation runner with the said arguments,
this is why you should create a debug configuration of `Android Instrumented Tests` type similar to the one below:

![Android Debug Configuration - Android Instrumented Tests](../../img/android-studio-debug-configuration.png)

Make sure to put breakpoints at the points of interest before you start the app.

After the app is launched, go back to the Terminal where Detox is running and press any key.
As a result, you are expected to see a confirmation from Detox, e.g.:

```plain text
Found the app (com.wix.detox-example) with process ID = 16854. Proceeding...
```

Now the entire test will run as usual until it sends an action to the app, which gets trapped
in your breakpoint.

Happy debugging!
