## Video Recording Issues on CI

For iOS, you might be getting errors on CI similar to this:

```plain text
Error: Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=22 "Invalid argument" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Video recording requires hardware Metal capability.}.
```

Unfortunately, this error is beyond our reach. To fix it, you have to enable hardware acceleration on your build machine, or just disable video recording on CI if it is not possible to turn on the acceleration.

There might be a similar issue on Android when the screen recording process exits with an error on CI. While the solution might be identical to the one above, also you might try to experiment with other emulator devices and Android OS versions to see if it helps.

## Detox Instruments is Installed in a Custom Location

If you have to use [Detox Instruments](https://github.com/wix/DetoxInstruments) installed in a custom location, you can point Detox to it with the `DETOX_INSTRUMENTS_PATH` environment variable, as shown below:

```bash
DETOX_INSTRUMENTS_PATH="/path/to/Detox Instruments.app" detox test ...
```

> **Note:** If **Detox Instruments** had been [integrated into your project](https://github.com/wix/DetoxInstruments/blob/master/Documentation/XcodeIntegrationGuide.md), then the integrated [Detox Profiler framework](https://github.com/wix/DetoxInstruments/tree/master/Profiler) will be used when profiling with Detox.

## `Ctrl+C` Does Not Clean Up Temporary Files

This is a known issue. :man\_shrugging:
After you press `Ctrl+C` and stop the tests, some of temporary files wonâ€™t get erased (e.g. `/sdcard/83541_0.mp4` on Android emulator, or `/private/var/folders/lm/thz8hdxs4v3fppjh0fjc2twhfl_3x2/T/f12a4fcb-0d1f-4d98-866c-e7cea4942ade.png` on your Mac).
It cannot be solved on behalf of Detox itself, because the problem has to do with how Jest runner terminates its puppet processes.
The issue is on our radar, but the ETA for the fix stays unknown.
If you feel able to contribute the fix to [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest), you are very welcome.
