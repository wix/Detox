Here are some known issues you can solve on your own:

1. **DetoxWSClient: Retrying... At connectToServer**

    ```plain text
    I/DetoxWSClient: At connectToServer
    D/DetoxWSClient: Retrying...
    ```

    If you see the repeatedly printed messages like above in Android application logs, it's likely
    that your port is not reversed. Assuming you're following the tutorial and `detoxServer` address
    is `ws://localhost:8099` (if not – check what Detox prints you), reverse the port on your device
    using ADB:

    ```bash
    adb reverse tcp:8099 tcp:8099
    ```

1. **Waited for the new RN-context for too long!**

    ```plain text
    Waited for the new RN-context for too long! (60 seconds)
    If you think that’s not long enough, consider applying a custom Detox runtime-config in DetoxTest.runTests().
    ```

    If you see an error like above, you can patch Detox code to disable the timeout here:

    ```diff title="detox/android/detox/src/main/java/com/wix/detox/config/DetoxConfig.kt"
     package com.wix.detox.config

     class DetoxConfig {
         @JvmField var idlePolicyConfig: DetoxIdlePolicyConfig = DetoxIdlePolicyConfig()
    -    @JvmField var rnContextLoadTimeoutSec = 60
    +    @JvmField var rnContextLoadTimeoutSec = Int.MAX_VALUE

         fun apply() {
             idlePolicyConfig.apply()
    ```
