# Your First Test

The previous articles have addressed the environment and project setup, and now it is time for writing
and running the tests.

If you are eager to check first whether your build configuration was correct, you can skip writing a test for now and try [running tests](#running-tests) instead, to identify potential [late issues](../troubleshooting/running-tests.md#no-simulators-found-ios) caused by incorrect project configuration.

## Writing a test

This subsection shows how to write a test which can:

* _launch_ the application,
* _tap_ on a button,
* and _assert_ that some text appears as a result.

Also, it will familiarize you with commonly used Detox [actions], [assertions] and [matchers] along the way.

### 1. Create a test suite

:::info Note

You can also duplicate and modify a `e2e/starter.test.js` file that was generated automatically by `detox init` command.

:::

Create a new test file under your `e2e` folder and add a similar test suite skeleton:

```js title="e2e/yourTestName.test.js"
describe('Example', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {});

  beforeEach(async () => {});

  it('should test something', async () => {});
});
```

### 2. Launch the application

When your test starts, the application is not running yet. You need to call [`device.launchApp()`](../api/device.md#devicelaunchappparams) at least once, e.g. in the `beforeAll` hook:

```js
describe('Example', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    await device.launchApp();
  });

  // …
});
```

If your app supports deep links, you can configure it to [start from a specific screen](../guide/mocking-open-with-url.md).

:::tip

It is a good idea to start every test from a fresh state, since the preceeding ones might leave your application
in an unpredictable state if they fail.

One way to do it is to launch the app as a new instance in `beforeEach` hook instead:

```js
beforeEach(async () => {
  await device.launchApp({ newInstance: true });
});
```

The other way is to _reload React Native_ without restarting the app. Like any live reloading, it is apt to cause glitches for more complex apps,
but for simpler apps it proves to be a quicker way to reset the state between the tests:

```js
beforeEach(async () => {
  await device.reloadReactNative();
});
```

So, pick your favorite one wisely, on the basis of _speed_ vs _stability_ considerations.

### 3. Match an element

The next step is to [match][matchers] an element you want to interact with.

Detox provides many options to match an element [`by.id()`], [`by.label()`], [`by.text()`] and [more][matchers].
The most common way to match elements is either by _id_ or _text_:

```js
element(by.id('YourTestID')); // recommended
element(by.text('Element text'));
```

:::info Best practice

Try to use [`by.id()`](../api/matchers.md#byidid) matcher wherever possible.
[Explore our guide](../guide/test-id.mdx) to learn how to work with `testID` props.

:::

### 4. Perform an action

Detox provides many actions on elements such as [`tap()`], [`swipe()`], [`scroll()`] and [other interactions][actions#more].

Let's tap on an element for the sake of the example:

```jsx
describe('Example', () => {
  // …

  it('should tap on a button', async () => {
    await element(by.id('ButtonID')).tap();
  });
});
```

:::info Note

You don't need to wait or "sleep" after interacting with an element, because Detox already does it for you.
It synchronises with your application and waits after each action for all the foreground activities to finish before performing any further step.

While convenient, this feature goes sideways at times, for example, when your app has looping animations causing Detox to wait forever.
This is why you sometimes have to tweak your app specifically for Detox tests, and [there is a special guide](../troubleshooting/synchronization.md) for that.

:::

### 5. Make an assertion

An essential step of any test is _making an assertion_.

Detox provides its own `expect` object, so that you can expect from any element [`toExist()`], [`toBeVisible()`], [`toHaveText()`] and [more various things][assertions#more].
All the assertions can be inverted with [`not` property](../api/expect.md#not).

Let's assert that our text is shown on a screen using [`toBeVisible()`] function:

```jsx
describe('Example', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    await device.launchApp();
  });

  beforeEach(async () => {
    await device.reloadReactNative();
  });

  it('should tap on button by id and expect some text to be visible', async () => {
    await element(by.id('ButtonID')).tap();
    await expect(element(by.text('The button has been pressed'))).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

Note that instead of matching by text you can assert a specific text on an element with [`toHaveText()`], e.g.:

```jsx
await expect(element(by.id('TextAfterButtonPressed'))).toHaveText('Button pressed');
```

## Running tests

<Tabs groupId="configurationName">
  <TabItem value="ios.sim.debug" label="iOS (Debug)">
    <RunningYourTest configurationName={'ios.sim.debug'} debug />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ios.sim.release" label="iOS (Release)">
    <RunningYourTest configurationName={'ios.sim.release'} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android.emu.debug" label="Android (Debug)">
    <RunningYourTest configurationName={'android.emu.debug'} debug />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android.emu.release" label="Android (Release)">
    <RunningYourTest configurationName={'android.emu.release'} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you haven't changed the generated `e2e/starter.test.js`, you are likely to see errors like this:

```
 FAIL  e2e/starter.test.js (25.916 s)
  Example
    ✕ should have welcome screen (662 ms)
    ✕ should show hello screen after tap (236 ms)
    ✕ should show world screen after tap (236 ms)

  ● Example › should have welcome screen

    Test Failed: No elements found for “MATCHER(id == “welcome”)”

    HINT: To print view hierarchy on failed actions/matches, use log-level verbose or higher.

      10 |   it('should have welcome screen', async () => {
    > 11 |     await expect(element(by.id('welcome'))).toBeVisible();
         |                                             ^
      12 |   });

      14 |   it('should show hello screen after tap', async () => {

      at Object.toBeVisible (e2e/starter.test.js:11:45)

```

If you have created your own test, and it is failing, examine the error message, check out our [Investigating Failures](../guide/investigating-test-failure.mdx)
and [Debugging](debugging.mdx) guides, and run your tests again after you fix the issue.
