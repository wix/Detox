     * oppose to *data*-ish notifications) on the device, where the sender simply provides only a title, some content
     * (body), and a flat key-value dictionary. What the FCM service does in the use case is to post a notification
     * with a simple launcher-like intent, holding the user data in the extra's root, as originally provided.
     * >Note: this is typically what happens only when the app is in the background/terminated; otherwise the notification
     * is delivered to the apps' registered handlers.
     *
     * Obviously, to properly expose more of what Android has to offer in this context, a more customizable version of
     * this (e.g. with more explicit intent-related configurations) should eventually be introduced as well.
