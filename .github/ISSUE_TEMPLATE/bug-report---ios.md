<!--
Place *Detox* logs under the "details" tag below. They can be obtained by passing the `loglevel` param: `detox test --loglevel trace`.

<!--
Paste *device* logs from the test device - associated with the failing tests, under the "details" tag below.
Device logs can be obtained by having Detox generate them as test artifacts (i.e. by providing the `--record-logs all` argument to the "detox test ..." command - see artifacts guide (https://wix.github.io/detox/docs/api/artifacts) for more info).
