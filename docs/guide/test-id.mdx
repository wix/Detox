# Adding testID to your components

:::info Note

This guide is applicable only for React Native applications.

:::

It is always the best idea to match your element by something unique. We recommend using [`testID` property](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#testid) supported by most React Native components:

```jsx
<View>
  <TouchableOpacity testID="MyUniqueId123">
    <Text>Some text</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
</View>
```

## Pass testID to your native components

Passing a `testID` to your custom component props has no effect until you forward it down to a native component like `<View />` or `<TouchableOpacity />`
that implements rendering it as an accessibility identifier in the native component hierarchy:

For example, you have `<YourCustomComponent />` and you pass a `testID` to it:

```jsx title="YourScreen.jsx"
function YourScreen() {
  return (
    <YourCustomComponent testID="YourCustomComponent" />
  );
}
```

Make sure that your implementation passes `testID` to some React Native component that supports it:

```jsx title="YourCustomComponent.jsx"
function YourCustomComponent(props) {
  return (
// highlight-next-line
    <View testID={props.testID}>
      <Text>Some text</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Child elements

If your component has several useful child elements, it is even a better idea to assign them some derived test IDs, e.g.:

```jsx title="YourCustomComponent.jsx"
function YourCustomComponent(props) {
  return (
// highlight-next-line
    <View testID={props.testID}>
      <Text testID={`${props.testID}.label`}>Some text</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

That way, you could refer to specific elements in Detox tests via the most basic and least ambiguous `by.id` matchers, e.g.:

```js
expect(element(by.id('YourCustomComponent'))).toBeVisible(); // the view is visible
expect(element(by.id('YourCustomComponent.label'))).toHaveText('Some text'); // the label has some text
```

### Repetitive components

It is highly not recommended to use non-unique `testID`, e.g. when your components get rendered in any sort of repeater or virtualized list:

```jsx title="YourScreen.jsx"
const ITEMS = [
  { title: 'First Item' },
  { title: 'Second Item' },
  { title: 'Third Item' },
];

function YourScreen() {
  const renderItem = ({ item }) => (
// highlight-next-line
    <YourCustomComponent testID={'listItem'} label={item.title} />
  );

  return (
      <FlatList
        data={ITEMS}
        renderItem={renderItem}
      />
  );
}
```

This would be a violation of accessibility guidelines and unnecessary complication for your test matchers.
Youâ€™d also have to use extra matchers and `.atIndex` clarification:

```js
expect(element(by.id('listItem')).atIndex(2)).toHaveText('Third Item');
```

Instead, you could generate a unique `testID` for every list item with the `index` property:

```jsx
  const renderItem = ({ item, index }) => (
    <YourCustomComponent testID={`listItem.${index + 1}`} label={item.title} />
  );
```

That way, your assertion would become simpler and more deterministic:

```js
expect(element(by.id('listItem.3'))).toHaveText('Third Item');
```

## Find your testID

:::note

Incorrect or absent `testID` is a common cause for test failure.
If your test can't find your `testID` and you can't see it either using tools described below, that usually means you haven't passed it down to this component.
Make sure you keep forwarding it down until it reaches a native component.

:::

To make sure your `testID` is indeed rendered in your app, you can use such tools as "View Hierarchy" for iOS and "Layout Inspector" for Android.

<Tabs groupId="mobileOs">
  <TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>
    <IOS />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android" label="Android">
    <Android />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
