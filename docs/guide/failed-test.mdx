# Investigating test failure

Before starting to dive deep in debugging your test it is worth to use some of the Detox tools, that help our users to understand the reason for the test failure.

## Using different log levels

You can specify which information you want to get about your test by specifying the log level, starting from least information with `fatal` to most information with `trace`.

```sh
detox test -c <configuration> -l [fatal/error/warn/info/verbose/trace]
```

:::tip
In most cases we recommend using `verbose` log level to understand the failed test better.

## Using Detox test artifacts

Artifacts are very powerful tool to understand your test failure, you can easily make a screenshot, video or even hierarchy of your app under test. Learn more about Detox test [artifacts here](https://wix.github.io/Detox/docs/api/artifacts)

### Screenshot app before and after test

```sh
detox test -c <configuration> --take-screenshots [manual/failing/all/none]
```

### Record video of your test

```sh
detox test -c <configuration> --record-videos [failing/all/none]
```

## Use debugger

In case options above are still not enough - it is time to jump into debugging our code, see our comprehensive about debugging [here](debugging.mdx).
