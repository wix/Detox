# Using Genymotion Cloud

As the number of your end-to-end tests grows, the overall test session duration might easily surpass an hour or two.
A good idea first would be to parallelize the test execution using your test runner (e.g. for Jest that
would be forwarding `--maxWorkers <N>`), but this approach has its limitations. Indeed, an average build agent would handle
running a few virtual devices at once, but running a dozen devices at once would make it slow and unreliable.

In other words, if you're experiencing scaling issues or struggling with managing local Android emulators,
a good idea would be to migrate to SaaS platforms, where you can start and stop devices on demand at any scale.
At the moment, Detox can offer you a first-class integration with
[Genymotion SaaS], the platform that offers cloud-based Android Virtual Devices.

## Prerequisites

You need to register an account in [Genymotion SaaS], so that you have valid credentials to use with their CLI tool,
[`gmsaas`]. If you have already an account there, make sure there are available device minutes. This is less of a concern
for the new accounts, as they get charged with 60 minutes for free.

Next, you should get `gmsaas` CLI tool [installed and configured][Genymotion SaaS tutorial],
so that you're able to see your e-mail after running this:

```bash
gmsaas auth whoami
# your_email@example.com
```

If you encounter errors instead, please revisit the [Genymotion SaaS tutorial] and check out their [Known Issues]
section if your problem persists.

## Configuring

To run tests on a device, you need to define its properties first: OS version, screen dimensions, etc.
This entire set of device specs is called a **recipe**. _Genymotion SaaS_ offers you a predefined list of recipes
to pick from, but you can create custom recipes as well. Refer to the [Basic Steps] tutorial on their website for
more details.

![](../img/genymotion/recipe.png)

Each recipe item in the list can be expanded for extra details, and that's where you can find its respective _UUID_.
Copy that UUID and use it to create a new device and a new configuration in your Detox config:

```diff title=".detoxrc.js"
 module.exports = {
   devices: {
     simulator: { /* ... */ },
     emulator: { /* ... */ },
+    genycloud: {
+      type: 'android.genycloud',
+      device: {
+        recipeUUID: '<paste your chosen recipe UUID>'
+      },
+    },
   },
   apps: {
     'ios.debug': { /* ... */ },
     'ios.release': { /* ... */ },
     'android.debug': { /* ... */ },
     'android.release': { /* ... */ },
   },
   configurations: {
     'ios.debug': { /* ... */ },
     'ios.release': { /* ... */ },
     'android.debug': { /* ... */ },
     'android.release': { /* ... */ },
+    'android.genycloud.release': {
+      device: 'genycloud',
+      app: 'android.release',
+    },
   },
 };
```

Although the _recipe UUIDs_ are guaranteed to be unique and never change unlike the _recipe names_, you still can use
the latter if you like – just switch from `recipeUUID` to `recipeName` property like this:

```diff
     genycloud: {
       type: 'android.genycloud',
       device: {
-        recipeUUID: '<delete your recipeUUID property>'
+        recipeName: '<paste the recipe name>'
       },
     },
   },
```

:::info

In the example above we assume you'll be running a _release configuration_ of your app since this is what
usually happens on CI.

Running _debug builds_ is trickier to set up (and might be less stable), but if you have to do it,
follow the instructions. You'll be setting up tunneling between your local machine (where React Native packager is
running on port 8081) and the remote device in the cloud.

First, patch your `MainApplication.java` (or your main activity class) to change `debug_http_host`, e.g.:

```diff
 package com.example;

 import android.app.Application;
+import android.content.SharedPreferences;
+import android.os.Bundle;
+import android.preference.PreferenceManager;

 import com.facebook.react.ReactApplication;
 import com.facebook.react.ReactNativeHost;
@@ -37,6 +40,9 @@ public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
     public void onCreate() {
         super.onCreate();
         SoLoader.init(this, /* native exopackage */ false);
+        SharedPreferences preferences =
+            PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(getApplicationContext());
+        preferences.edit().putString("debug_http_host", "localhost:8081").apply();
     }

 }
```

Now, as your React Native app will be forced to use `localhost:8081` to download the bundle, you'll need to make sure
that there is a tunnel between your local machine and the remote device – add 8081 to `reversePorts` in your app config,
e.g.:

```diff
  'android.debug': {
    type: 'android.apk',
    binaryPath: 'android/app/build/outputs/apk/fromBin/debug/app-fromBin-debug.apk',
    build: 'cd android && ./gradlew assembleFromBinDebug assembleFromBinDebugAndroidTest -DtestBuildType=debug && cd ..',
+   reversePorts: [8081],
  },
```

Clean your Android build intermediates and build your app again:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean # remove ./ on Windows
cd ..
detox build -c android.emu.debug
```

If your application is trivial enough, these adjustments should be already enough to run _debug builds_ remotely.

:::

## Running

Assuming you have created a new `android.genycloud.release` configuration, run:

```bash
detox test -c android.genycloud.release
```

Soon enough you'll be seeing an output like this:

```
Allocating Genymotion-Cloud instance Detox.62dfc57b-3201-c861-29bb-8f31f60a8d39.w1 for testing.
To access it via a browser, go to: https://cloud.geny.io/instance/8fc62d21-3de0-4ed8-bf18-e69b90246dc5
```

After you make sure the tests run as intended, try running multiple workers to pick the optimal
count of workers for your project:

```bash
detox test -c android.genycloud.release --maxWorkers 8
# DETOX_CONFIGURATION="android.genycloud.release" jest --config e2e/jest.config.js --maxWorkers 8
# …
```

## Caveats

### Termination

If you have to terminate your tests execution via `Ctrl+C` or another forcible way, pay attention to
the warnings printed, e.g.:

```plain text
detox[22314] i WARNING! Detected a Genymotion cloud instance leakage, for the following instances:
detox[22314] i Instance Detox.1e0ee8a4-6949-90c7-6680-5c3a9010d1e5.w1 (8fc62d21-3de0-4ed8-bf18-e69b90246dc5)
    Kill it by visiting https://cloud.geny.io/instance/8fc62d21-3de0-4ed8-bf18-e69b90246dc5, or by running:
    gmsaas instances stop 8fc62d21-3de0-4ed8-bf18-e69b90246dc5
```

Leaving the device unattended would mean spending extra money :grimacing: :dollar:, so make sure to follow the
instructions and stop your instances, e.g.:

```bash
gmsaas instances stop 8fc62d21-3de0-4ed8-bf18-e69b90246dc5
```

We plan to improve this behavior and secure emergency teardown someday, but beforehand the next issue
should be resolved (see it below). Besides, `Ctrl+C`'ing proves to be useful when you want to leave the device active
at some point of your test scenario and interact with it manually.

### Ignored behavior

Detox CLI has [`-u, --cleanup` option], and the behavior config has the respective [`shutdownDevice`
property], but **none of them has effect** on _Genymotion SaaS_ devices. Detox always shuts them down in the end
of the test session (unless you terminate it abruptly – see the previous caveat).

This is a **known issue** which stems from the older one. Originally these flags meant _"shutting down the devices
after all the tests have been executed"_, but historically it had always been working
as a _"shut them down after each test file"_ instead.

Taking into account that starting a device in Genymotion SaaS is apt to take about a minute, we chose to hard-code
the more cost-effective strategy as a lesser evil. This is why we'll be always stopping your
instances in the end until there's a proper fix to `shutdownDevice` behavior.
