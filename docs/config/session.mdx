# Session

:::info Note

It is not recommended to customize this section unless [you are debugging native code](../introduction/debugging.mdx)
or contributing to the native iOS/Android code of Detox.

:::

The `session` section tells Detox how to set up its web socket server and client. They are used to forward the JSON-serialized expectations and element interactions to the native implementation of Detox side-loaded with the app.

## Location

<Location sectionName="session" />

## Properties

There is one important thing to note when you’ll be defining a session config, e.g.:

### `session.server` \[string]

Default: `ws://localhost:{randomPort}`.

```json
{
  "session": {
// highlight-next-line
    "server": "ws://localhost:8099"
  }
}
```

When you define a URL for `server`, it automatically sets [`session.autoStart`](#sessionautostart-boolean) to _false_ (mainly due to backward compatibility reasons), so make sure to override it back if you didn’t intend that.

### `session.sessionId` \[string]

Default: a random UUID, e.g. `7731871e-2f07-46bb-acbc-cb0eb6a0ace7`.

Since the Detox server is a single entity, but there can be multiple test workers running multiple devices and apps,
it needs to understand which connection belongs to which app.

Detox forwards `sessionId` to the app as a launch argument, so the app immediately knows where to connect to.

:::caution

Defining an explicit `sessionId` means you cannot use **multiple workers**,
since the specified session will become busy for any test worker next to the first one to occupy it.

```json
{
  "session": {
    "server": "ws://localhost:8099",
// highlight-next-line
    "sessionId": "YourProjectSessionId"
  }
}
```

:::

### `session.autoStart` \[boolean]

Default: `true` for undefined `session.server`, and `false` for defined.

Controls whether Detox web socket server will be starting automatically.
If `false`, it is assumed that you will be running it independently via [`detox run-server`](../cli/run-server.md) CLI command.

```diff
   "session": {
+    "autoStart": true,
     "server": "ws://localhost:8099",
     "sessionId": "YourProjectSessionId"
```

### `session.debugSynchronization` \[number]

Default: `10000`.

Tells Detox how long (in milliseconds) to wait for the app to become idle until it starts querying it for more details.

```json
{
  "session": {
    "debugSynchronization": 20000
  }
}
```

Detox will be printing the list of busy idling resources every time an action takes more than the specified period, e.g.:

```plain text
15:13:07.309 detox[17005] i The app is busy with the following tasks:
• There are 10 work items pending on the dispatch queue: "Main Queue (<OS_dispatch_queue_main: com.apple.main-thread>)".
• UI elements are busy:
  - Layers pending animations: 96.
  - Layers needs layout: 173.
  - View needs layout: 74.
  - View needs display: 98.
  - Layers needs display: 90.
• Run loop "Main Run Loop" is awake.
```

To disable this behavior (i.e. querying the app periodically), set the value to `0`.

Seeing logs like these usually indicates certain issues in your application, as mentioned in the [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting/synchronization.md).
