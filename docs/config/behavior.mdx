# Behavior

If you need to tweak the flow of `detox.init()` or `detox.cleanup()` steps,
you have a few options to change. These are the default behavior values:

## Location

<Location sectionName="behavior" />

## Default values

```json
{
  "behavior": {
    "init": {
      "reinstallApp": true,
      "exposeGlobals": true,
      "keepLockFile": false
    },
    "launchApp": "auto",
    "cleanup": {
      "shutdownDevice": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Properties

### `behavior.init.reinstallApp` \[boolean]

Default: `true`.

When _true_, Detox will uninstall and install the app upon the initialization.

Setting it to _false_ forces the tests to use the previously installed app on the device,
provided you have installed it beforehand [explicitly](../api/device.md#deviceinstallapp) or manually.

### `behavior.init.exposeGlobals` \[boolean]

Default: `true`.

When _true_, it forces Detox to expose `device`, `expect`, `element`, `by` and `waitFor`
as global variables.

When _false_, you should import them explicitly instead:

```js
const { by, device, expect, element } = require('detox');
```

or, in TypeScript:

```js
import { by, device, expect, element } from 'detox';
```

### `behavior.init.keepLockFile` \[boolean]

Default: `false`.

When _false_, `detox test` command always deletes the shared lock file on start,
assuming it had been left from the previous, already finished test session. The lock file
contains information about busy and free devices and ensures no device can be used
simultaneously by multiple test workers.

Setting it to _true_ might be useful when if you need to run multiple `detox test` commands
in parallel, e.g. test a few configurations at once with a simple Bash script:

```bash
detox reset-lock-file & \
detox test -c iphone.release & \
detox test -c ipad.release & \
detox test -c android.phone.release & \
detox test -c android.tablet.release & \
wait;
```

:::caution Known issue

You can't run multiple `detox test â€¦` commands simultaneously with `android.genycloud` (Genymotion SaaS)
devices due to [a known issue](https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/3573). We'll get on this as soon as
we can.

:::

### `behavior.launchApp` \[enum]

Default: `auto`.

Possible values: `auto`, `manual`.

When set to `manual`, Detox won't be launching your app automatically. Instead, it will
be waiting until you launch it manually from IDE and press any key to resume the test
execution. This is useful when you want to [debug the native codebase](../introduction/debugging.mdx) when running Detox tests.

Also, setting it to `manual` resets `behavior.reinstallApp` to _false_.

### `behavior.cleanup.shutdownDevice` \[boolean]

Default: `false`.

When set to _true_, Detox will shut down the device after the tests finish.

:::caution Known issue

Currently Detox shuts down the device after completing every test file, and that makes the test session unnecessarily long
and inefficient. This is [a known issue](https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/2894) and we plan to fix it as soon
as we can.
