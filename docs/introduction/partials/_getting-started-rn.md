Detox was built from the ground up to support "classic" React Native projects.

:::info Note

While Detox should work out of the box with almost any React Native version from the past few minor releases, official support is provided for React Native versions `0.70.x` and `0.71.x` without React Native's ["New Architecture"](https://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/landing-page).

Newer versions, as well as React Native's "New Architecture", may work with Detox, but have not been tested out yet by the Detox team.

Although we do not officially support older React Native versions, we do our best to keep Detox compatible with them.

Also, in case of a problem with an unsupported version of React Native, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/new/choose) or write us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/CkD5QKheF5) and we will do our best to help out.
