Detox was built from the ground up to support "classic" React Native projects.

:::info Note

While Detox should work out of the box with any React Native version of the latest minor releases,
the _official_ versions compatibility is provided according to the following:

- **RN `v0.73.x` - `v0.79.x`:** Fully compatible. That includes React Native's ["New Architecture"](https://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/landing-page).
  Newer RN versions might work with Detox, but they've not been thoroughly tested by the Detox team yet.
- **RN â‰¥ `v0.77.x`:** Compatibility with the _old_ RN architecture is no longer maintained; Detox may not be stable in these configurations.

Although we do not officially support older React Native versions, we do our best to keep Detox compatible with them.

Also, in case of a problem with an unsupported version of React Native, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/new/choose) or write us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/CkD5QKheF5) and we will do our best to help out.
