:::caution Note

Expo support with Detox is entirely a community driven effort. We have no specific support in Detox for Expo applications (ejected or otherwise).

:::

There are a few resources on the Internet covering how to set up Detox with Expo apps:

- <https://github.com/fschoenfeldt/clean-expo-detox-testing>
- <https://toshev.medium.com/setting-up-detox-with-a-expo-managed-react-native-project-89342dce4df>
- <https://blog.expo.dev/testing-expo-apps-with-detox-and-react-native-testing-library-7fbdbb82ac87>

Unfortunately, we have no capacity to maintain this direction and hold no responsibility for content and
quality of the mentioned or another available resources.

For support on how to use Detox with Expo, you should contact the Expo team or the Expo community. If you
are seeing an issue, it is most likely not an issue with Detox itself, but with the Expo runtime or with
an incorrect Detox setup. Genuine issues with Detox can be submitted to [our issue tracker](https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues)
as usual.

The tutorial below is useful, but is **not enough** to complete the setup with Expo.
