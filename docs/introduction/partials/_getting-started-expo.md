:::caution Note

Expo integration with Detox is entirely a community-driven effort.
We have no special support for Expo projects, and we do not maintain any Expo-specific code or documentation.
:::

There is a tutorial on how to set up Detox with Expo projects, which you can find on Expo official documentation site: [Running E2E tests on EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/e2e-tests/). It is a great starting point for projects that are using Expo.

For support on how to use Detox with Expo, you should contact the Expo team or the Expo community.

If you are experiencing a bug, which you believe is a Detox issue, please [open an issue](https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues) on our GitHub repository.

This introduction section is useful for Expo projects, but the next [Project Setup] article, in particular, is **not enough** to complete the setup with Expo. Please follow the [Expo guide](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/e2e-tests/) instead.
