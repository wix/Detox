## Mocking User Notifications

Detox supports mocking user notifications.

> **Note:** The mocking mechanism will not mimic the UI of a user notification. Instead, it will only simulate a user interaction with the notification - namely, the "opening" of it (equivalent to a user’s tap/swipe on it in the notification center).

### Mocking App Launch With a Notification

`launchApp()` with custom parameters (i.e. `userNotification`) will trigger the mocking mechanism.

```js
await device.launchApp({newInstance: true, userNotification: notification});
```

#### Example

```js
describe('Launch with push notification', () => {
  it('should handle the notification', async () => {
    await device.launchApp({
      newInstance: true,
      userNotification: userNotificationPushTrigger,
    });
    await expect(element(by.text('From push'))).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Mocking Notification Reception on a Running App

Use the `sendUserNotification()` method to send notification to **running** app. Notifications can be sent to an active or a background app.

> Note: while the name `sendUserNotification()` is not very idiomatic on Android, as notification data is not "sent" to apps (rather, it is bundled into an Activity/Service launch Intent as Intent-extras), this unified API is used, for the time being, for both platforms equivalently. With [plans of a more extensive support](https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/2141) for Android, we estimate it would be deprecated when the time comes.

```js
await device.sendUserNotification(notification);
```

**Example:**

```js
describe('Foreground user notifications', () => {
  it('should handle the local notification from inside the app', async () => {
    await device.launchApp();
    await device.sendUserNotification(localNotification);
    await expect(element(by.text('from local notification'))).toBeVisible();
   });
});
```

### Notification JSON Format

User notifications are passed as JSON objects to Detox. The JSON object needs to provide some required data, but can also provide an additional, optional payload.

**Mind the major difference here between the two platforms.** While on iOS many types of data fields are applicable, Android is very loosely defined - with support for just free-form user data in the `payload` field.

##### Trigger Types

There are four types of triggers supported by Detox at this time:

- `push`
- `calendar`
- `timeInterval`
- `location`

For convenience, these trigger types are provided as constants in `DetoxConstants`:

```js
const DetoxConstants = require('detox').DetoxConstants;

const userNotification = {
  "trigger": {
    "type": DetoxConstants.userNotificationTriggers.push
  },
  // ...
}
```

| `longitude` | Yes      | Number     | The longitude in degrees. Measurements are relative to the zero meridian, with positive values extending east of the meridian and negative values extending west of the meridian. |

#### Payload

On Android, the content will be available via the activity’s [`getIntent()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#getIntent\(\)) API, inside the intent’s _extra_ bundle. Under some limitations, that includes data-cascading so as to provide comprehensive support for JavaScript’s advanced object-hierarchy capabilities as much as possible. As an example, consider this payload:

```javascript
const userNotification = {
  payload: {
    userData: 'userDataValue',
    userDataNum: 111.2,
    userDataFlag: true,
    userDataArray: ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'],
    userDataObj: {
      cascadedKey: 'cascadedValue'
    },
  },
};
```

The outcome on the native side will be such that all of these conditions evaluate to _true_:

```java
activity.getIntent().getStringExtra("userData") == "userDataValue";
activity.getIntent().getDoubleExtra("userDataNum") == 111.2;
activity.getIntent().getBooleanExtra("userDataFlag") == true;
activity.getIntent().getStringArrayExtra("userDataArray")[0] == "rock";
activity.getIntent().getBundleExtra("userDataObj").getString("cascadedKey") == "cascadedValue";
```

##### Handling at Runtime

Note that on Android, data delivered through an intent at runtime, is typically received in your activity’s [`onNewIntent`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onNewIntent\(android.content.Intent\)) callback. Be sure to consider what should be done in order to handle this type of a use case in your app: Namely, that `setIntent()` should be called in order for the data to be later available in your app through `getIntent()`, as explained earlier.

> **This isn’t related to Detox in particular**, and is set here simply to help you consider all the use cases in your app so that tests coverage would be optimal.
